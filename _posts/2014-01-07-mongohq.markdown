I  use MongoHQ to host data for my meteor applications because it's fast and easy. In order to make meteor aware of MongoHQ, set the MONGO_URL environment variable with the URI of your database:

{% highlight bash %}
export MONGO_URL="mongodb://userid:password@paulo.mongohq.com:10086/your_databasename"
{% endhighlight %}

Check out [MongoHQ][mongohq] for more info.
