I  use MongoHQ to host data for my meteor applications because it's fast and easy. Getting meteor to point to MongoHQ is easy, just set the MONGO_URL environment variablea as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
export MONGO_URL="mongodb://userid:password@paulo.mongohq.com:10086/your_databasename"
{% endhighlight %}

Over time, as my data requirements grow, I may re-evaluate this decision and decide to host locally on my AWS servers.
