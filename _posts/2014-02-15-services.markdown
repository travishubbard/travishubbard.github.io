I've been locked down all winter doing some work for a great customer down in Miami, they are prepping to lauch a site that will revolutionize the way domains are built out into valuable properties - then resold. It has been a great experience.

With the good comes the bad. I've not been able to focus on a few of my personal products, and have not focused as much on my local peeps.

That needs to change. I need to meet for coffee locally, not over Skype all the time.

If you are in the D.C. area, let's meet up.
