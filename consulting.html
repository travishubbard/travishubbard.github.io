  <h1>Consulting Services</h1>

	<p>
		Technical advice goes a long way, and you need experienced technical insight regardless of where your projects sits on the development timeline: evaluating ideas, designing a prototype, building a team or outsourcing to a development shop.
	</p>

	<p>
		I am a seasoned software engineer and technology entrepreneur. I’ve started and sold consulting companies, developed software products and online applications from the ground up, and managed projects from inception through delivery.
	</p>

	<p>
		The supply of technical co-founders is low; I’m here to help until you find your long-term solution.
	</p>

	<h2>Initial Meeting (Buy me a coffee)</h2>

	<p>
		Schedule an hour over to talk about the technical requirements for your idea. I'll answer questions like:
	</p>
	<div class='post'>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Is my idea technically feasible?
				</li>
				<li>
					Which parts of my idea will prove to be a technical challenge?
				</li>
				<li>
					Which parts are already easily solved with existing technology?
				</li>
				<li>
					Is an outsourced team a realistic option for our prototype?
				</li>
				<li>
					Here's my experience so far with my development team - should I be worried?
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</div>

	
	<h2>Research and Follow-up ($150 per hour)</h2>

	<p>
		If we agree that you will benefit from our relationship, you are welcome to continue to a further stage. I am generally unavailable for a lengthy engagement, but prefer to schedule in blocks of hours to perform tasks such as:
	</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Assess performance of your internal or external technical and project management teams.
			</li>
			<li>
				Systems/Component Integration and test strategies.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reviewing product specifications and anticipating issues before you spend your money.
			</li>

			</li>

				Proposal reviews prior to submission.
			</li>

			</li>
		</ul>
