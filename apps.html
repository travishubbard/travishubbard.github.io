		<a href="http://burpeeboard.com">BurpeeBoard</a> - Burpees are great exercise, I used to do them all day in the Marine Corps...although we just called them a "squat thrust" -- but who am I to split hairs?
		</p>
		<p>
			BurpeeBoard is used to track burpees performed over time. Use the system, get more karma and become way cool over time. :)

		<p>
			Developed specifically for owners of local CrossFit (or similar) boxes to build a sense of community, marketing, competitions, etc. Can be customized to your specifications.
