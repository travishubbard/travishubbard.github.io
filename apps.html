				<a href="http://burpeeboard.com">BurpeeBoard</a> - Burpees are great exercise, and you look so awesome doing them. I think we called them a "squat thrust" in the Marine Corps, which I always found a little intimidating - particularly when I was in the front of the line. But I digress...
			</p>
			<p>
				BurpeeBoard is used to track burpees performed over time. Use the system, get more karma and become way cooler than your friends. Seriously.
			</p>
			<p>
				BurpeeBoard is a Software as a Service (SaaS) application developed specifically for owners of local CrossFit boxes (or similar type establishments) to help build a sense of community, target marketing efforts, organize competitions, etc.
			</p>

			<p>
				BurpeeBoard uses <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_jump">Meteor</a>, stores its data on <a href="http://www.mongohq.com/home" target="_jump">MongoHQ</a> and is hosted on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_jump">AWS</a>. We use <a href="http://www.iron.io/worker" target="_jump">IronWorkers via Iron.io</a> to demonstrate the "Full Stack Reactivity" principle of Meteor apps.

			<p><strong>Let us customize BurpeeBoard to your specifications.</strong></p>
