			<a href="http://burpeeboard.com">BurpeeBoard</a> - Burpees are great exercise, and you look so awesome doing them. I think we called them a "squat thrust" in the Marine Corps, which I always found a little intimidating - particularly when I was in the front of the line. But I digress...
		</p>
		<p>
			BurpeeBoard is used to track burpees performed over time. Use the system, get more karma and become way cooler than your friends. Seriously.
		</p>
		<p>
			Developed specifically for owners of local CrossFit boxes (or similar type establishments) to help build a sense of community, target marketing efforts, organize competitions, etc.

		<p><strong>Can be customized to your specifications.</strong></p>
