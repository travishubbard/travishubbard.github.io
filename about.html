<div id="about">
  <h1>About</h1>

	<p>
		I could load this up with a bunch of BS in an attempt to make you think New London Software is a big company and include mulitple &quot;catch-all&quot; specialities for &quot;SEO&quot; purposes, but I won't.
	</p>

	<p>
		We focus on solving problems, specifically software engineering, application development and project management.
	</p>

	<p>
		Applications and API developed using: JavaScript (Node, Meteor, Angular, Bootstrap, underscore, etc.) MySQL, MongoDB, Ruby, Python, Java, Amazon Web Services (SNS, SQS, S3) and Heroku.
	</p>
